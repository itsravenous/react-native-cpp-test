# React Native C++ Code Example

This repository shows the usage of custom C++ code to be used in a React Native project. The benefits are shared code between Android and iOS, as well as performance benefits for certain algorithms.

Have a look at [react-native-cpp-code](https://github.com/reime005/react-native-cpp-code) for the React Native module and C++ code.
